    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>The webpage will be designed around the visualization of my collected data, wherein I will include 
    a variety of charts as to best portray all of the different dimensions to my statistics.
    I also intend to add interactivity with the graphs, such as possibly displaying something
    when you hover your cursor over a graph, or the clicking of a button to change some part of
    the application. There will also be additional information which 
    may appear displayed alongside the graphs, wether that is to provide better clarification, 
    or to give my own personal thoughts relevant to the data at hand.</p>
